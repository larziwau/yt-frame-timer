# YT Frame Timer

A JavaScript-based tool for determining the time between start and end points of a YouTube video, down to the frame level. Originally created to assist moderators in retiming speedruns on [speedrun.com](https://www.speedrun.com/). This tool is based on [Slush Puppy's Retime Tool (SPRT)](https://github.com/Slush0Puppy/retime), created by @SlushPuppy (special thanks to them for their work!).
